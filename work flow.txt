*Example Flow*

You open the page → fill in Date: 21-10-2025, Name: Ramesh, Amount: 500, Pooja counts.

Flask saves it in counter.db with a unique Did (like Xy12Zf).

You can later go to /users → see Ramesh’s record.

Or /list → see all records and total ₹ collected.

You can also search “Ramesh” or filter by “21-10-2025”.
